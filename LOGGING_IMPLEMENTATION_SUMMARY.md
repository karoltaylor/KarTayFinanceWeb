**Logs:**
```
🛡️ ========== PROTECTED ROUTE CHECK ==========
🛡️ ProtectedRoute state: { loading, hasUser, userEmail }

OR
🚫 No user found - showing Login page
```

- Environment variables validation
- URL information logging

**Logs:**
```
🚀 ========== APP MOUNTED ==========
🌍 Environment Info: { hostname, href, pathname, ... }
🔧 Environment Variables: { apiBaseUrl, firebaseProjectId, hasFirebaseApiKey }
```

---

## 🎯 What These Logs Will Help You Identify

### 1. Environment Issues
- ✅ Verify correct environment variables are set
- ✅ Confirm Firebase config is loaded
- ✅ Check if running in localhost vs production mode
- ✅ Validate auth mode (POPUP vs REDIRECT)

### 2. Authentication Flow Issues
- ✅ Track when user clicks login button
- ✅ See if redirect completes successfully
- ✅ Monitor auth state changes
- ✅ Identify where the flow breaks

### 3. Backend Integration Issues
- ✅ Check if backend registration succeeds
- ✅ See backend API responses
- ✅ Identify API connection problems
- ✅ Track user ID storage

### 4. Routing Issues
- ✅ See when ProtectedRoute checks auth state
- ✅ Understand why user is redirected to login
- ✅ Track loading states
- ✅ Monitor authentication status

## 🔍 How to Use the Logs

### Step 1: Open Developer Tools
- Press `F12` or right-click → Inspect
- Go to **Console** tab

### Step 2: Clear Console
- Click the 🚫 (clear) icon
- This ensures you see fresh logs

### Step 3: Attempt Login
- Click a login button (Google, Facebook, or GitHub)
- Complete the OAuth flow
- Return to the app

### Step 4: Review Logs
Look for the following sequence:

```
✅ Good Flow:
🚀 APP MOUNTED
🔥 FIREBASE INITIALIZATION
🔵 AUTH INITIALIZATION START
🔐 LOGIN BUTTON CLICKED
🚀 GOOGLE SIGN-IN INITIATED
[Redirect to Google]
[Return from Google]
🚀 APP MOUNTED (again, after redirect)
🔍 Checking for redirect result...
✅ Redirect authentication successful!
🔔 AUTH STATE CHANGED → ✅ User authenticated
✅ Backend registration successful
🛡️ PROTECTED ROUTE CHECK → ✅ User authenticated
✅ Rendering protected content
```

```
❌ Bad Flow (Redirect Loop):
🚀 APP MOUNTED
🔥 FIREBASE INITIALIZATION
🔵 AUTH INITIALIZATION START
🔐 LOGIN BUTTON CLICKED
🚀 GOOGLE SIGN-IN INITIATED
[Redirect to Google]
[Return from Google]
🚀 APP MOUNTED (again, after redirect)
🔍 Checking for redirect result...
ℹ️ No pending redirect result  ← Problem here!
🔔 AUTH STATE CHANGED → ❌ No user
🛡️ PROTECTED ROUTE CHECK → 🚫 No user found
🔐 Rendering Login page  ← Back to login!
```

---

## 🚨 Common Issues to Look For

### Issue 1: No Redirect Result
```
🔍 Checking for redirect result...
ℹ️ No pending redirect result
```
**Cause:** Firebase didn't complete the redirect properly
**Solution:** Check Firebase authorized domains

### Issue 2: Missing Environment Variables
```
❌ Firebase API Key not configured!
```
**Cause:** Environment variables not set in AWS Amplify
**Solution:** Add variables in Amplify Console

### Issue 3: Backend Registration Fails
```
❌ ========== BACKEND REGISTRATION ERROR ==========
```
**Cause:** Backend API not accessible or CORS issues
**Solution:** Check VITE_API_BASE_URL and backend CORS config

### Issue 4: Wrong Auth Mode
```
🔧 Auth Mode: POPUP (Development)
```
But you're on AWS Amplify (should be REDIRECT)
**Cause:** Hostname detection issue
**Solution:** Check Environment logs

---

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to AWS Amplify
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add extensive authentication logging"
git push
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Amplify
Go to Amplify Console → Environment Variables:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
VITE_API_BASE_URL=... (your backend API URL)
```

### 3. Test on Amplify
- Open your Amplify app URL
- Open browser console (F12)
- Attempt login
- Review logs

### 4. Share Logs
If you need help:
- Copy all console logs
- Look for ❌ errors
- Share the log sequence

## 📖 Documentation

See **DEBUGGING_AUTH_GUIDE.md** for:
- Complete log flow documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Common issues and solutions
- Step-by-step debugging instructions

---

## 🎉 Benefits

With these logs, you can now:

✅ **Track entire auth flow** from start to finish
✅ **Identify exact failure point** in authentication
✅ **Verify environment configuration** is correct
✅ **Monitor redirect handling** in real-time
✅ **Debug backend integration** issues
✅ **Understand routing decisions** by ProtectedRoute
✅ **Validate Firebase configuration** at startup

---

## 🔒 Production Considerations

### These logs are safe for production because:
- No sensitive data is logged (passwords, tokens)
- Only metadata is shown (emails, UIDs are expected to be in logs)
- Helps diagnose production issues
- Can be disabled later if needed

### To disable logs later:
1. Search for `console.log` in the codebase
2. Replace with a logging utility that can be toggled
3. Or use a build flag to remove in production
